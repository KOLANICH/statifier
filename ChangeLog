  anymore)

- from the cpus/*/properties.src removed 
   'prop_stack_under_executable' and

  for executable's creation.
- my_lib.inc.c - added new function my_fread_whole_file
- src/Makefile was changed in order to decrease dl-var size on amd64

  for the future processing.

* Mon Jul 19 2004 <valery_reznic@users.sourceforge.net> 1.6.0-1

  that loader's base address always same !

  LD_PRELOAD is set - at least on amd64) output messages, which
  not new-line terminated. '(no debugging symbols found)...'
  So, statifier.gdb now output file separator to the gdb's log file
  which begin with newline.

- statified executable include also non-allocated sections 
  from original exe. It don't affect application running,
  but make statified exe more friendly to gdb, objdump, readelf, etc.
  To achive it, starter segment format was changed: now it NOT include
  section headers. 
  phdrs.c now create two output files: starter_segment and sections.

  from original exe.
  statifier_create_exe.sh was changed to deal with it.

* Wed Jun 16 2004 <valery_reznic@users.sourceforge.net> 1.5.0-1

  dump symbol. It help to detect present of thread local storage
  for stripped loader too.
  GetSymbol function from statifier_lib.src now printed out second field 
  instead of first, because objdump's and readelf's output formats are 
  bit different. 
- phdrs.c was changed to write output to the file instead of stdout.
  statifier_create_exe.sh was changed to reflect this change. 

* Tue Jun 15 2004 <valery_reznic@users.sourceforge.net> 1.4.0-1

  GET_DATA_ADDR macro was moved from start.S to cpus/*/processor.h 
  added define 'MY_JUMP' to cpus/*/processor.h.
  end.S now use 'MY_JUMP' 
- added copy_ehrd.c program
