- fix section headers.
- add support for RTLD environment variables.
- support linux on the platforms other than x86
- support other unixes.
- minimize usage of external programs: readelf, objdump.
  ( awk, sh, sed looks ok,  aren't they ?)
- think about gdb. From one side it's provide an easy
  and (I hope !) portable enouth way for dump memory mappings
  and registers. From another side - it's one more dependencies.
- write de-statifier, which will re-create original exe file
- write more tech documentation.
- what about output file license
