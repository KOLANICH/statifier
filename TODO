- add TLS (thread local storage) support - DONE. 
- fix section headers - DONE. RH9 very sensitive to correct section headers.
  add section with strings to the statified exe ?
- rework tls_test - I'll need to specify interpreter from real exe,
  instead of hardcoded one.
- do not use objdump for finding _dl variables - it's not work
  for stripted /lib/ld-linux (for example some SuSE versions)
- add support for RTLD environment variables.
- support linux on the platforms other than x86
- support other unixes.
- minimize usage of external programs: readelf, objdump.
  ( awk, sh, sed looks ok,  aren't they ?)
- think about gdb. From one side it's provide an easy
  and (I hope !) portable enouth way for dump memory mappings
  and registers. From another side - it's one more dependencies.
- write de-statifier, which will re-create original exe file
- write more tech documentation.
- what about output file license
