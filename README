Statifier create from dynamically linked ELF executable
and all it's libraries (and all LD_PRELOAD libraries if any)
one file. This file can be copied and run on another machine
without need to drag all it's libraries.

Statifier use following software:
- awk
- bash
- objdump
- readelf
- sed
- gdb.

Gdb version should support 'generate-core-dump' command.
(For linux x86 it's  gdb-5.2, as it written in gdb's NEWS,
I test it with gdb-5.3
