Porting ELF statifier to new cpu

1. Look for 'uname -m' output for the cpu name. 
   This name will be used later.
   
2. You may want convert real cpu name as shown by 'uname -m'
   to 'canonical name' - for example, different x86 computers
   can return i386, i486, i586, i686, athlon; and
   canonical name set to i386.
   
   If you need convertion add to the configure script
   in the 'case "$PROCESSOR"' appropriative line.

   Otherwise, canonical_name = real_name

3. In the file Makefile.common add to the SUPPORTED_CPU_LIST
   canonical_cpu_name

4. In the directory configs add file config.<canonical_cpu_name> and
   adjust it as appropriative for your system

5. Create directory cpus/<canonical_cpu_name>
   This directory should contain following files:

   processor.h         - file which described some processor specific things.
   regs.list           - list of processor's integer registers
   set_thread_area.gdb - command file for gdb to dump set_thread_area
                         parameters.
   dl-var.S            - module for set _dl variables
   set_thread_area.S   - module for invoke set_thread_area syscall
   regs.S              - module to restore registers 
                         and jump to _dl_start_user 

   properties.src      - define different system properties.
