1.6.4
   nasty bug in the 1.6.3 distribution fixed - gdb_ruuner.gdb
   file was incorrect. So unless you use 1.6.3 from CVS
   it simple does not work.

1.6.3
   support for kernel 2.6 (with thread local storage) on x86_64

1.6.2
   statifier now work with loader ld-2.3.3
   Innovation in this loader, which affect statifier are:
      (possible) spliting stack to two segments (rw and rwx)
      GNU_RELRO segment - after data written to segment it's 
      permission changed to read-only

1.6.1
   statifier work on RHEL3.2

1.6.0
   statifier was adopted to work with RHEL 3 and 3.1
   all phrdrs (except PT_INTERP and PT_PHDR) are copied to the
   statified file, so it's preserve, for example PT_GNU_STACK,
   which used by exec-shield.
   Statifying now should be possible on the systems with exec-shield
   and randomization enabled. 
   Code now assume nothing about memory layout, so porting
   will be easier.

1.5.0
   Statifying now possible on system with stripped loader.
   Statified exe now more friendly to gdb, readelf, objdump, etc.

1.4.0
   Porting to alpha.
   Some more documentation.

1.3.1
   Added documentation.
   Some underground work for future portings

1.3.0
   Now it's really work for linux kernel >= 2.5
   Added options --set and --unset, which allow set / unset environment
   for statified program without affecting statifier itself.
   Added options --verbose and --keep-working-directory for debugging purpose. 
   Work with non-gnu awk too (as in debian) 
   Suppressed gdb's (>= 6.0) message: rtld.c: No such file or directory

1.2.1
   Added support for linux kernel >= 2.5
   Big internal changes.
   
1.2.0
   Added support for amd64 (x86_64) processor
   Added examples to man page

1.1.1
   Added missing path to set_threa_area_addr
   Fixed segfault in the statified executables which used
   function dlsym, and dlsym can't find symbol.
   But now statifier more depend on symbols to be found in the interpreter.
   (SuSE with stripted symbols will not work)

1.1.0
   Added support for TLS - thread local storage.
   Now statifier work on Linux RH9 too.

1.0.0
   First public release. 
   Tested on linux x86
